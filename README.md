# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The JavaScript application, the Romantic Novel Cover Generator, offers a range of features for creating and saving novel covers. Users can generate random covers, save them, and even create their own custom covers by providing their own image, title, and descriptors. The application also provides a convenient view where all the saved covers can be accessed on a single page. Aspiring authors seeking inspiration for their novel covers can utilize this generator to spark ideas for their own creations. Additionally, the application includes a "Make Your Own Book" form, empowering users to visualize their unique concepts by generating personalized book covers.### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We diligently collaborated on the project throughout the duration of five days, dedicating a minimum of 4 hours each night. Our work sessions were facilitated through Slack, where we regularly initiated huddles to discuss progress and address challenges. Whenever we hit a roadblock, we occasionally hopped on the study hall zoom to see if anyone could lend a hand. Now, we're heading into week three of module one and still going strong!

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Develop functionality using JavaScript to interact with HTML and CSS.
2. Implement techniques to manipulate the webpage dynamically without requiring a page reload.
3. Enhance our skills in writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript code by following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
4. Improve our ability to read and comprehend existing codebases.
5. Cultivate teamwork skills by collaborating effectively to code, communicate, troubleshoot, and plan together.


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Successfully implementing modular functions that accomplish specific tasks and combining them to achieve larger functionalities.
- Accomplishing the rendering of covers on the page while successfully updating the data model.
- Fostering a positive and respectful team culture, while promoting a safe space to contribute ideas and ask questions without fear of judgment.
Challenges:
- Overcoming the challenge of making the books appear miniature on the "saved covers" page and formatting them to be displayed in a consistent inline manner. Through trial and error, the team tested various functions and realized there was a "mini cover" class defined in the CSS file. They experimented with this class to correctly display the images and achieve the desired formatting.
